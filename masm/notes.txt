Design notes and things to do
-----------------------------

Q: Should the finders store their own step_size, or should that be defined in the pose?
  - Key issue is whether different points may require different step sizes - never needed that yet.
  A: No.

Q: How should RoI for search be defined?
  - Fixed search region defined in the model in local units?
  - World RoI passed in though search()?
  - World RoI passed in though a separate function?  

Q: Have a separate class for finding sets of points (which would allow dynamic programming?)
  - No, keep it simple.  If necessary have a separate ASM class to do that.

ToDo:
  - Fit quad fn to local values?
  - Allow is_1D variant?
  - Complete the documentation
  - Linear regression finder:
    - Compute fit value?
    - Add step value so only sample sparsely
    - Compute weight mat properly (not axis aligned)
    - Allow 1D variant which only predicts along i-axis.

masm_searcher:
- Add scaling factor for when prior used in fit_to_points* to allow for different weighting of prior vs local model response wt_mats?
- Arrange that update computes movement, and search stops if movement below a threshold?
- Store curves within the ASM?

Tidy up tools/masm_search_image
 - Flags to set colours etc

ToDo:
- Add flag to masm_sample_grad_region to tweak normalisation.

Current experiments suggest that NCC local models outperform region_pdf models by some margin on faces (training on aflw, testing on bioid).
